# tweet-analysis-project
 A project for my class `Big Data`, utilising a variety of new techniologies which i am unfamiliar with in order to conduct various analysises of historical tweet data, in a fashion which would be suitable for a streaming scenario.

## Why?
The idea for this project was prompted due to my experience being that general discourse online had seemed to be getting progressively less respectful, taking on a more negative general sentiment...

With this in mind i thought it would be curious to determine to what level this experience was measurable (if at all), or if it was simply an artefact of my own "Filter Bubble".
